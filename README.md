## Architecture Constraints & Trade-offs

### Context API + DDD Integration

This project implements a **hybrid architecture** that combines Domain-Driven Design principles with React Context API due to explicit technical requirements. While this approach fulfills assessment criteria, it introduces architectural compromises that are worth documenting:

**Constraint:** The technical specification requires Context API for state management, which creates a tension with clean DDD implementation.

**Architectural Impact:**

- **Layer Contamination:** The Context layer now handles both React state management and calls to domain services, violating single responsibility principle
- **Redundant Data Flow:** `Component ‚Üí Context ‚Üí DDD Service ‚Üí Repository` introduces an unnecessary intermediate layer for simple data fetching scenarios
- **Mixed Paradigms:** Context API's imperative dispatch pattern conflicts with DDD's declarative service approach

**Implementation Approach:**
The Context layer has been adapted to serve as a thin facade over DDD services. While this maintains compliance with requirements, it represents a compromise between clean architecture and specification adherence.

**Future Scalability Considerations:**
This hybrid approach, while over-engineered for the current 3-view application, establishes a foundation for enterprise scenarios where the architecture would become more justified:

```typescript
// Potential future state management
const AppState = {
  user: UserAggregate,
  subscriptions: SubscriptionAggregate,
  favorites: FavoritesAggregate,
  podcasts: PodcastAggregate
}

// DDD services handling complex business logic
userService.subscribe(podcastId)
  ‚Üí subscriptionService.addSubscription(user, podcast)
  ‚Üí favoriteService.checkConflicts(user, podcast)
  ‚Üí notificationService.sendConfirmation(user)
```

In such scenarios, Context API would manage state of multiple aggregates while DDD services orchestrate complex business logic between entities, making the current architectural foundation strategically valuable.

**Trade-off Assessment:**

- ‚úÖ **Compliance:** Meets technical assessment requirements
- ‚úÖ **Functionality:** Maintains all required features and caching behavior
- ‚úÖ **Future-proofing:** Establishes scalable foundation for complex business scenarios
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Architecture:** Introduces layer mixing that complicates responsibility boundaries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Maintenance:** Additional complexity in data flow for state synchronization

This documentation serves to acknowledge the architectural tension while demonstrating understanding of both current constraints and long-term architectural vision.
